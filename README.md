# Global-Temperature-Analytics
I have looked at the global surface temperature and tried to make some meaning full insights into them. I have also tried to predict Bangalore's temperature and used SARIMA Model for the same .

SAMARIMA Model parameters - (p,d,q) = (3,0,0) ; (P,Q,D,S) = (0,1,1,12)


For all the plots please look at the google colab link . Some of the plots are not visible on Github. The link for the same is available on Climate_Data_1.ipynb

## Data Source 
All the data was collected from Kaggel - Link for the same - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?datasetId=29&sortBy=voteCount
